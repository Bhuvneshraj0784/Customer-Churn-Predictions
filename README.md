# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning techniques and identifies key factors influencing churn.

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn dataset containing customer demographics, services, and billing information.

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC–AUC

## Key Insights
- Contract type, tenure, and monthly charges are major drivers of churn.
- Random Forest outperformed the baseline model.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
